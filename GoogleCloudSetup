# Setting up a project with Google Cloud Platform
- I set this up with Google's console, and then using command to set up Shiny Server and NGINX.
- This also assumes it is a personal project and not enterprise.

<i>If you already have a GCP started, jumped to launching the compute engine.</i>

### First Steps
1. Go to Google Cloud, and click get started for free in the top right
2. Select country and agree to ToS
3. Set up account information

### Launching Compute Engine
1. Go to Compute Engine
2. Go to VM Instance
3. Select Create Instance
  a. Name your instance
  b. Set region
  c. Depending on needs, I have selected a standard N1 instance, which runs me between $12-$15 per month for a dedicated vm
  d. Set boot to Ubuntu 19.10
  e. Set to allow HTTP & HTTPS traffic
4. Wait for your instance to initialize (~10 secs)
