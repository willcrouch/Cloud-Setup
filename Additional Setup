This is additional work I have found necessary when debugging new shiny apps that have failed to work:

This work was for an app that used tidycensus & sf in conjunction with leaflet
- First issue came from units
$ sudo apt-get update -y
$ sudo apt-get install -y libudunits2-dev

- Second issue came with rgdal
$ sudo apt install libgdal-dev
